First File.
The file getting processed and the converted postfix notations are abc*+ and Invalid Expression.
One more statement to test your coding skills to handle the character arrya without using any builtin funciton, 
so show this expression in to prefix form -/*a b ^+c d f g . 
The skill test doesn't stop there,
you have to evaluate on more statement to prove your  skills on basic stack working. 
Evalaution result of provided strings are (a+(b*c)).

 So,you said you enjoyed the previous assignment and learned much and more :). Now, tell me the about the number of galxies in the picture.
Total galxies in picture are 3. 

this is just check your stack handling skills.  so i hope you will pass  this test alsoso keep going . So, now I am  tried of this thing.  I think that's enough.

			 3rd File.
The file getting processed and the converted postfix notations are -acbc*+ and Invalid Expression.
One more statement to test your coding skills to handle the character arrya without using any builtin funciton, 
so show this expression in to prefix form -/*ag bn ^+c d f g . 
The skill test doesn't stop there,
you have to evaluate on more statement to prove your  skills on basic stack working. 
Evalaution result of provided strings are 57.

 So,you said you enjoyed the previous assignment and learned much and more :). Now, tell me the about the number of galxies in the picture.
Total galxies in picture are 2. 

This is simply a test of your stack management abilities. So, I hope you pass this test as well, so keep going. So now I'm sick of this stuff.  That, I believe, is sufficient.

Process this file Convert the given Infix expressions to postfix expression using standard algorithm. AB–CDE$$+FG*H/-                   and xy^5z*/2+ and ++a *b c d  .

                Show your Coding skills and Dont use any built-in function for handling character array
Read the below algorithm
         Steps to Convert Postfix to Infix :
Read the symbol from the input .based on the input symbol go to step 2 or 3.
If symbol is operand then push it into stack.
If symbol is operator then pop top 2 values from the stack.
this 2 popped value is our operand .
create a new string and put the operator between this operand in string.
push this string into stack.
At the end only one value remain in stack which is our infix expression.

Input the the expression to convert it into Infix form Invalid Expression and Invalid Expression. 

Wait you have to do one more task to complete this assignment
you have to evaluate on more statement to prove your  skills on basic stack working. 
Show the result if the given string after evaluation -14.

 Did you miss assignment 1?. Now, tell me the about the number of galxies in the picture. ):
Total galxies in picture are 2. Don't forget to save the genrated images in output folder.

This is simply a test of your stack management abilities. So, I hope you pass this test as well, so keep going. So now I'm sick of this stuff.  That, I believe, is sufficient.
